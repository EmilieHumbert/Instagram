# instagram

## Brief decription
An Instagram clone built with Next.js, Firebase and Tailwind CSS. This React project has multiple pages: login, sign up, dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos), and user profiles. The sign-in page connects to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up. Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook. After this application was built, it was deployed to Vercel. Lighthouse was also used to improve the website performance.
